## About The Project
Being a space enthusiast and growing tired of having to Google ‚Äúwhen is the next space x launch date‚Äù. I thought I'd build something that myself and friends could quickly use to check and track this information.

As I'm relatively new on my web development journey, I wanted to test my skills and push what I could build. After finding an open-source API, sketching some ideas and deciding what data I wanted to use from the API. I set upon building.
